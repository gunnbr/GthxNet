# GthxNet
Gthx website rewritten in Asp.NET

# Why?
Gthx already has an implementation in Angular. However, it has a bunch of security problems that have been found in the npm modules it's using.
But some of those are old enough that the fixed versions have completely changed the API so it would pretty much need to be rewritten anyway.
Meanwhile, I have some upcoming contracts that may be using Asp.NET, so I'd like to learn it. I'm also assuming that Asp.NET projects are easier
to return to as they have support from Microsoft to fix security problems. If I happen to implement this and not touch it for 2 years, perhaps
I'll be able to immediately pick it up, compile, and publish it. And, since I have a Microsoft Developer account, I also have credit for
Azure services every month. This also gives me a chance to learn Azure and switch my hosting to there as I've got free hosting anyway.
